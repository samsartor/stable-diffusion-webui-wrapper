# Wrapper for Automatic111's stable-diffusion-webui

This repository creates the `s9pk` package that is installed to run `Stable Diffusion` on [embassyOS](https://github.com/Start9Labs/embassy-os/).

## Building

The process of building the package is the same as for pretty much any other start9 wrapper repository. If you have the dependencies installed and submodules checked out, just run `make`.
