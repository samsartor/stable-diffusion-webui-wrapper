# Wrapper for Automatic111's stable-diffusion-webui

This repository creates the `s9pk` package that is installed to run `Stable Diffusion` on [embassyOS](https://github.com/Start9Labs/embassy-os/).

## Building

The process of building the package is the same as for pretty much any other start9 wrapper repository. If you have the dependencies installed, just run `make`.
