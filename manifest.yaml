  short: Private AI image generator
  long: |
    Stable Diffusion is a generative model that can create new images based on text prompts,
    or similarly modify existing images. This application is like MidJourney or DALL-E 2 in concept,
    but provides far more user control and is entirely self-hosted and private.

    READ CAREFULLY! Stable Diffusion Web UI has *no authentication*. If someone gets
    ahold your unique Tor address, they will be able to generate images using your server.
    They will *not* be able to see your image generation history. This service is in early
    stage development! Minimal functionality and some bugs are expected. This service can
    use significant system resources, so beware when running it alongside other services
    that use significant system resources, such as Bitcoin or electrs.
